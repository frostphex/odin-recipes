    <p>This shepherd's pie is just like the one my mom used to make, but it's made with vegan ingredients. All amounts are approximate and can be altered to your tastes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Mashed potato layer:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/<sub>2</sub> cup vegan mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/<sub>2</sub> cup soy milk</li>
      <li>1/<sub>4</sub> cup olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bottom layer:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
      <li>1/<sub>2</sub> cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) package vegetarian ground beef substitute</li>
      <li>1/<sub>2</sub> cup shredded Cheddar-style soy cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn the heat to medium-low, and boil potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes; drain.</li>

      <li>Stir vegan mayonnaise, soy milk, olive oil, vegan cream cheese, and salt into potatoes, and mash with a potato masher until smooth and fluffy. Set mashed potatoes aside.</li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

      <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion, carrots, celery, frozen peas, and tomato until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper.</li>

      <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and crumble vegetarian ground beef substitute into the skillet with vegetables. Cook and stir, breaking up the meat substitute, until the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Spread vegetarian meat substitute mixture into the bottom of the baking dish, and top with prepared mashed potatoes, smoothing them into an even layer. Sprinkle potatoes with shredded soy cheese.</li>

      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and slightly browned and the casserole is hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
