    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>3 baby carrots, grated (Optional)</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
      <li>1/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>
